What road type had the most fatalities? 

The greater the risk profile of the road the greater the chance of a fatality. 
For example - a National Highway with a higher speed limit has a riskier profile and thus leads to more fatalities from crashes. National or State Highway had the highest number of fatalities from crashes followed by Arterial Road and then Local Roads. 

What day of the week had the most fatalities from crashes?

The sheer volume of cars on the road significantly contributes to the increased accident risk during weekends. 
Canadian statistics support our findings which indicate that Saturdays witness the highest number of cars on the road, followed by Fridays and Sundays. 

What time of day leads to the most fatalities from crashes (Victoria only)?

The time of day with the most fatal crashes was 4pm and the time with the least fatalities was 4am.
Minimal fatal crashes in the early hours is likely due to less traffic with most people asleep. Fatal crashes rise slightly from 6:00 to 9:00 AM during the morning commute and spike significantly between 16:00 and 19:00, aligning with evening rush hour.

Have the number of fatalities from crashes changed over time?

Overall fatalities from crashes have reduced over time. There are a number of factors reducing the crashes over time:
Vehicle safety features including air bags and electronic stability control, inreased seat belt usage, stricter law implementation on drugs and alcohol, improvement in vehicle design, and COVID led to less cars on the road in  2021.

Are there more fatal crashes on weekdays or weekends?

When the data was normalised for the number of days in weekdays and weekends, it was found that weekends contributed to more driver fatalities. Contributing factors were: increased use of drugs and alcohol on weekends, increased motor vehicle usage by teenagers on weekends leading to higher deaths, and increased drivers / cars on the road on weekend. 

Which road users were most  impacted by crashes?

The road user which was most impacted by fatal crashes was the driver (45.1%) of all fatalities followed by the passenger (23.1%) and then by  pedestrians (15.6%).

In Victoria, which gender has the most fatal crashes? 

There was a higher proportion of fatal crashes involving male drivers compared to female drivers. Male drivers are     involved in almost three times  as many fatal crashes as female drivers. This could be due to numerous reasons. Firstly, men might simply dirve more and spend more time on the road due to their occupation as taxi drivers, truck drivers etc. Furthermore, men might also engage in more risky behaviour and gender norms could influence men to be the "designated driver" of the group/couple. 

Which driver age group causes the most fatalities? 

When the data was normalised it showed that the age group between ‘17 to 25’ accounted for more than one third of crashes. The next two largest respectively were ‘26 to 39’ and ‘40 to 64’ age groups. Younger age groups are more prone to speeding except for the ‘0 to 16 age group’ who supervised whilst on learners permits.

Which state has the most fatalities per capita (population)? 

Using an API to derive the population of the state and territorries of Australia. It was found that Northern Territory had the highest proportion of fatalities from crashes on a per capita basis. NSW and VIC had the highest number of fatal crashes but when normalised the proportion was lower per capita.
