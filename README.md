Which road users were most  impacted by crashes?

The road user which was most impacted by fatal crashes was the driver (45.1%) of all fatalities followed by the passenger (23.1%) and then by  pedestrians (15.6%).

In Victoria, which gender has the most fatal crashes?  

There was a higher proportion of fatal crashes involving male drivers compared to female drivers. Male drivers are     involved in almost three times  as many fatal crashes as female drivers. This could be due to numerous reasons. Firstly, men might simply dirve more and spend more time on the road due to their occupation as taxi drivers, truck drivers etc. Furthermore, men might also engage in more risky behaviour and gender norms could influence men to be the "designated driver" of the group/couple. 

Which driver age group causes the most fatalities? 

When the data was normalised it showed that the age group between ‘17 to 25’ accounted for more than one third of crashes. The next two largest respectively were ‘26 to 39’ and ‘40 to 64’ age groups. Younger age groups are more prone to speeding except for the ‘0 to 16 age group’ who supervised whilst on learners permits.
