In Victoria, which gender has the most fatal crashes?  

There was a higher proportion of fatal crashes involving male drivers compared to female drivers. Male drivers are     involved in almost three times  as many fatal crashes as female drivers. This could be due to numerous reasons. Firstly, men might simply dirve more and spend more time on the road due to their occupation as taxi drivers, truck drivers etc. Furthermore, men might also engage in more risky behaviour and gender norms could influence men to be the "designated driver" of the group/couple.
